        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove the todu from the package and set between 2 cutting boards to squeeze out extra moisture</li>
            <li>While tofu is pressing, add rice into rice cooker with 1 cup water and start the rice cooker</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F</li>
            <li>Prepare broccoli by chopping off florets off at the stalk. May need to cut larger florets into 2 </li>
            <li>Move broccoli to a large bowl and toss with 1 tbsp oil and pepper and salt</li>
            <li>Place broccoli on baking sheet</li>       
            <li>Remove tofu from press and pat dry with a paper towel</li>
            <li>Cut tofu into roughly 3/4 inch cubes (should be about 24 pieces)</li>
            <li>Move tofu into a bowl and lightly toss with the corn starch</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large pan or skillet. You want the depth of the oil to be about half the heigh of the tofu cubes</li>
            <li>Place broccoli into oven and cook for about 15 minutes or until it has some nice browning</li>
            <li>Gently place the tofu in the hot oil and fry for about 5 minutes flip them and cook for another 5. They should be a nice golden brown</li>
            <li>Remove tofu from oil and set aside on a plate with a paper towl to absorb extra oil</li>
            <li>In a measuring cup or small bowl stir together the peanut butter, soysauce, rice vinegar, honey, garlic, ginger, red pepper flakes, and a 1/4 cup of water</li>
            <li>Place sauce in a pan over medium heat and cook to meld the flavors together. Add more water as needed for desired consistency</li>       
            <li>Remove broccoli from the oven</li>
            <li>Plate up, first adding rice to the bowl, then tofu and broccoli. Shower everything in peanut sauce and enjoy!</li>
